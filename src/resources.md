# Resources
Interested in data compression? Great! We list a few resources (apart from the lecture notes) which might be useful to take a look

## [1.1] Software
A great way to learn about data compression is to play around with the compression algorithms themselves. 
1. [Stanford compression Library](https://github.com/kedartatwawadi/stanford_compression_library): A library of compression algorithms implemented in native python for accessibility and educational purpose. Take a look at the tutorials (in progress)  to get started! We will also be using the library as a basis for the course assignments.

## [1.2] Video Resources
Interested in data compression? HEre are some nice youtube videos to watch to get an introduction. Most of them are beginner-friendly and are useful to get a sense of the data compression. Some of the videos in the **Detailed videos** section are a bit more detailed, and should be perused slowly! 

If you find a video not listed here, please file an issue!

Here are a set of videos to watch at leisure to get an intuition for compression:
1. [Compressor Head playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb7rzMxHyOk&list=PLOU2XLYxmsIJGErt5rrCqaSGTMyyqNt2H&ab_channel=GoogleDevelopers): This is a series of short talks by a google engineer. Very good introductory videos
2. [Huffman Coding (Tom Scott)](https://youtu.be/JsTptu56GM8): I love Tom Scott and how well he explains things. Here is a nice video on Huffman coding
3. [Why Snow looks terrible on video](https://youtu.be/r6Rp-uo6HmI), [Why Night scenes look bad on video](https://youtu.be/h9j89L8eQQk): Very nice two videos by Tom Scott again which gives a brief peek into video compression algorithms
4. [PNG Image Compression](https://youtu.be/EFUYNoFRHQI): video on PNG lossless compression
5. [JPEG compression](https://youtu.be/0me3guauqOU): A bit more detailed video on JPEG compression
6. [Arithmetic coding series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE125425EC837021F): Great sequence of lectures Information theory in general and particularly on Arithmetic coding. One of the best I found on this subject

## [1.3] Textbooks, research papers
Although there are no textbooks which exactly correspond to the course material, but here are few books which might be relevant. 

## [1.5] Blogs/websites
The web is filled with great engineers and researchers writing blogs related to Data Compression. We list a few below:
1. [Christopher Olah's Blog](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-09-Visual-Information/): A fun visual introduction to Information Theory.
